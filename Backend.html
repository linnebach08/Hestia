						<h2>Hestia Backend</h2>
						<p>The backend of the Hestia application constists of a Microsoft SQL Database and a RESTful Web API.</p>
					</header>
					
					<h3>Database</h3>
					<p> The database for Hestia is a Microsoft SQL database hosted by Azure in the US West Region. We chose to use an SQL
						database because it was the type of database that we are all the most familiar with and because we are using Azure
						to host everything with our project it made sense to make it a Microsoft SQL database. To design the database we first
						constructed a full ER diagram showing the relationships we would need between each entity in the database. From here we
						created the database by using the diagram to construct create table queries with the correct columns as well as primary
						key, foreign key, and uniqueness constraints. Over the course of the project the database has been updated as our needs 
						have changed and this updating has once again been done through SQL queries. In total the database consists of over 25 
						tables which work together to store all user information including their budget, recipe, grocery list, household, and 
						to-do list data.
					</p>
					<h3>Web API</h3>
					<p> The other portion of the backend of the Hestia application is the RESTful Web API. This API was designed using the
						.NET Framework and is the middleman module between the frontend of our application which diplays the data and our
						database which stores the data. This API sets up 60+ endpoints which the application frontend can use to create, 
						retrieve, update, and delete the data that is stored in the database. There are endpoints set up for every portion 
						of the application and this API eliminates the need for the frontend to ever directly communicate with the database.
