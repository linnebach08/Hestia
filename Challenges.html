					<h3>Software Challenges</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
              <li>Configuring a reliable communication protocol between the app and sensors
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Current Plan: Use bluetooth to communicate between the app and sensors. This has been proven to be reliable in past projects.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Designing the database which will form the backend of our app
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Current Plan: We will choose a reliable and cheap SQL database engine. Then, we will create our database server and structure it around the entity-relationship model.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Making the app look visually appealing to users
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Current Plan: We will beta test the app design with users before release and two of our members already have app design experience.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
	<h3>Hardware Challenges</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
              <li>Making the bracelet heart rate monitor small enough to fit comfortably on the wrist and accurately measure the heart rate
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Current Plan: We know it has been done before so it is possible. The components should be small enough to make it work and we are all currently getting embedded system design experience.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Figuring out battery/charging for the bracelet and straw
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Current Plan: We can either have our systems run on solar power or we can make our bracelet and straw rechargable through a standard USB-C cable.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Configuring the liquid sensor to accurately measure water intake
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Current Plan: We have found a water sensor that we can use to measure the water depth and then create an embedded system to read and transmit this data. Then we can use depth to measure volume by using a water bottle with a known size.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
