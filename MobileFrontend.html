						<h2>Hestia Mobile Frontend</h2>
						<p>The Mobile Frontend for the Hestia application constists of both the Android and IOS mobile applications we developed </p>
					</header>
				<h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
					<p> The Hestia Mobile Apps are built using NativeScript. This is a framework which supports both Android and IOS development
						using the same code which is the reason we chose to use it to develop the mobile application. Both the mobile apps are
						identical on either platform and once the mobile app is downloaded the user can login or create an account and once 
						logged in they can view all their information. There is a separate
						page for each feature of the application. There is a tasks page which serves as the user's to-do list. A Budget page
						which allows the user to access, modify, create, and delete budgets. A calendar page which shows all of the user's 
						calander events and allows the user to add, update, and delete events. Lastly, there is the setting page which allows a user to see the members
						in their household, invite new users to the household, and leave their household if they desire. All these pages work by making requests to the 
						API and updating the data shown on the pages accordingly. Through these mobile application the user should be able to better manage their life 
						which is the main goal of Hestia.
