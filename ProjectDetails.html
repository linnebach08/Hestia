					<h3>Abstract</h3>
  						<p> HeartStrawng by Healthy Bois. Water is an essential part of life as we know it. Without it, life would be dry. Here at HealthyBois we understand that remembering to drink
  							enough water each day can be difficult. That's why we developed HeartStrawng. Heart Strawng is a combination of an adaptable drinking straw and bracelet heart rate monitor to 
  							track your water intake and heart health while connected to the HealthyBois app. Our app allows you to set goals, see results, and feel a sense of accomplishment as you achieve 
  							them.  The app helps visualize your water intake and heart rate over time and will give you friendly reminders to help keep you on track with your personally set health goals.
  							This will help people stay on track and on top of their health goals which science has proven, makes you more likely to be satisfied with your life.
