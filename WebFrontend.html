						<h2>Hestia Web Frontend</h2>
						<p> The web frontend for the Hestia application consists of our Identity Server that is used for
							user authentication and the Web Portal which serves as the actual Hestia web application</p>
					<h3>Identity Server</h3>
					<p> The Identity Server is used for password encryption and user authentication at login as well as password resets. 
						We chose to use the IdentityServer4 framework to establish an Identity Provider server because the protocol it implements, 
						OpenID, is the latest technology and will provide enhanced security over just using something like ASP.NET. Furthermore, it 
						provides a separation of concerns: user credentials and CRUD for user credentials are all found in one place, and if we were 
						to create another application, the said application could also use this Identity Provider for authentication and authorization 
						services. Lastly, although this has been the most time-consuming and high-tech route we could have taken for user authentication, 
						establishing a Hestia Identity Server will give our app a professional appeal and provide our team with a valuable learning experience.
						Overall, this server ensures that user information will be protected while using the Hestia application.
					</p>
					<h3>Web App</h3>
					<p> The Web application of Hestia is a web portal built using Angular. This is a framework which both of our web app 
						developers have experience with and therefore the decision was made to build the web application using Angular.
						Once at the web app the user can login or create a new account and once logged in they can view all their information. There is a separate
						page for each feature of the application. There is a tasks page which serves as the user's to-do list. A Budget page
						which allows the user to access, modify, create, and delete budgets. A calendar page which shows all of the user's 
						calander events and allows the user to add, update, and delete events. Then, there is the meals page which allows a 
						user to create recipes and schedule these recipes on a certain day making them a meal. Also in this page is the grocery 
						list feature which allows a user to export the ingredients from the scheduled meals to their grocery list and allows the
						user to manually add and delete grocery list items. Lastly, there is the setting page which allows a user to see the members
						in their household and invite new users to the household. All these pages work by making requests to the API and updating the
						data shown on the pages accordingly. Through this web application the user should be able to better manage their life which is the 
						main goal of Hestia.
